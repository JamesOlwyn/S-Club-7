        <div class="box-text">
            Born in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and having lived in Papua New Guinea for most of my schooling years, I migrated to New Zealand in 1999. I grew up where food was the centre of almost everything, from family gatherings to special occasions. Yearly celebrations such as the Sinhala and Tamil New Year and Christmas means the preparation of authentic cuisine - that reflects the Sri Lankan tradition and made with intention and care.

The passion to share the authentic cuisine of Sri Lanka has inspired me to open the doors to Rasai.

I welcome you to my table!
