                <h1>Welcome to Rasai</h1>
                <p>Rasai in Sinhalese means “tasty.” It reflects the authenticity, the richness, and the vibrancy of Sri Lanka’s diverse culinary traditions. Complex and vibrant, Sri Lankan cuisine is well known for its combination of herbs and spices and is centered around many varieties of rice. Coconut milk, oil and pulp also play a significant role in the cuisine, as is preserved fish. A hub in the historic oceanic Silk Road, contact with foreign traders brought new food items and cultural influences in addition to the local traditions of the country's ethnic groups, all of which have helped shape the cuisine of Sri Lanka. I have a passion for preparing authentic and traditional Sri Lankan meals, through trialing different combination of spices to bring out the best flavours of meat, seafood and vegetables. I am inspired to share my Sri Lankan heritage and culture through authentic dishes from my homeland.</p>
